## 📌 Projects

### 🧠 Face Recognition in Disguise
- **Tech:** Python, Tkinter, OpenCV, NumPy, PIL, CSV, Pandas, OS Module  
- **Description:** Developed a Python-based project utilizing the Haar Cascading algorithm for real-time disguised face detection. Implemented machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and recognition efficiency.  
- **Outcome:** During face recognition, it compares live webcam input with the trained data, identifies the person if a match is found, and displays their details along with accuracy. If no match is found, it labels the person as "Unknown" and captures their image for future reference.
